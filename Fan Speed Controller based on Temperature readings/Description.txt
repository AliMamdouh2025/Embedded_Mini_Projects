This project involves developing a fan speed control system based on temperature readings using an ATmega32 microcontroller. It utilizes GPIO for input/output operations, ADC for converting LM35 sensor readings, PWM for motor speed control, and an LCD for displaying temperature and fan speed.
Technology used:
GPIO, ADC, PWM, LM35 Sensor, LCD, and DC Motor, ATmega32.
